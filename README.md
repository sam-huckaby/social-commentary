social-commentary
=================

A Bible commentary site that is social in nature and allows users to write out their thoughts about passages as well as follow their friends and see what their thoughts are.

The goal will be to eventually allow users to do the following things:
- Search for Bible verses or passages
-   In whatever version they choose
-   See notations for how much has been written on each verse
- Follow other users to see which verses they are writing about
- More to come
